    "The next step after successfully fitting a model to the astronomical spectrum is the analysis of the model fit. The Sculptor *SpecAnalysis* module is designed to make this task easy with your Sculptor fit. While fitting a single function (e.g., a Gaussian) to an emission or absorption feature may be easy to analyze, deriving important quantities, such as the width, peak flux or equivalent width from multi-component line fits can be more tedious. Luckily, the *SpecAnalysis* module includes all of this functionality already. \n",

    "However, before we begin, we need to import the most important python packages. We will use numpy and the astropy.units and astropy.cosmology packages as well as the three sculptor modules *SpecOneD*, *SpecFit*, and - the topic of this notebook - *SpecAnalysis*.\n",
